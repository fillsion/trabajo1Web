            <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Alarm System for Security</h6>
            <p class="card-text">Built an alarm for security system on a house complex located at Bogota DC. This alarm 
                was created using Java and had as objective to notify all members registered by phone, a message that 
                would say somenthing like "Call the police! Gatehouse is in danger!". The job required that the alarm 
                would be built in a local computer located at the reception and that receptionists could access it
                 just pressing the "end" in the keyboard.

            <p class="card-text">This project named baltoapp required the inscription of different pets into a database
                so that a veterenary could handle different information regarding a given pet. The app would say if a pet is
                in need for medical attention and if a pet is for adoption. Also the database could hold the medical records
                 for the pet and other information. This app was built using Java for the main project and MySQL sever for the 
                 database.

            <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Crowdfunding</h6>
            <p class="card-text">In recent years, crowdfunding (a financing network where individuals collectively contribute monetarily to third-party
            projects or goals) has gained much recognition for the socioeconomic impact it provides (Fan-Osuala, 2017). Due to the
            above, through this work we seek to provide a technological and financial solution to the need for capitalization of the
            MiPymes of the Aburr√° Valley. This solution is based on a crowdfunding model that will be supported through a
            multiplatform application to conveniently connect investors with companies that need financing and thus provide
            facilities to projects in an early stage of growth so that they can sustain themselves and reach a break-even point
            where your mortality (bankruptcy) rate is not as high.</p>
